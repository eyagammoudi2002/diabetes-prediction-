# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project aims to predict diabetes using various machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The goal is to achieve accurate predictions by training and evaluating these models on a diabetes dataset.


## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early prediction of diabetes can help in better management and treatment of the condition. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various medical attributes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). The dataset contains 768 rows and 9 columns. The columns represent various medical attributes such as glucose level, blood pressure, insulin level, etc., along with the target column indicating whether the patient has diabetes.



## Models

The following machine learning models are used in this project:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple, instance-based learning algorithm.
- **Decision Tree**: A tree-structured model used for classification and regression.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees for better accuracy.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classifier that works well with high-dimensional data.
